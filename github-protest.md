## I am Using GitHub Under Protest

This project is currently hosted on my [personal
forge](https://git.blob42.xyz/sp4ke/yargs) and mirrored on GitHub. This is not
ideal; GitHub is a proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open
Souce Software (FOSS).  I am deeply concerned about using a proprietary system
like GitHub. If you want to contribute I encourage you to do so through the
orignal repo and avoid Github.  I urge you to read about the [Give up
GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from [the Software Freedom
Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why
GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done

code in Copilot.
